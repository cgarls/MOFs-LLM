Abrahams, Patricia A. Jackson, and Richard Robson* A major goal in the crystal engineering of coordination polymers is the design and synthesis of microporous networks that maintain structural integrity upon exchange or loss of channel guest molecules. One strategy to achieve more robust framework structures that we have been developing is to harness the powerful chelate effect by employing bridging ligands that bind metal centers strongly at chelating sites. The planar ligand 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (hat, 1) provides a pleasingly symmetrical array of three bidentate sites at which metal centers can realistically be expected to be strongly and predictably bound, each site closely resembling those in the classical chelating agents 2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10phenanthroline. The ligand hat has already been put to use to bind trios of metal ions in discrete molecular species, [1] but our interest is to generate infinite networks.\", 'COMMUNICATIONS 2658 \\ue617 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim, 1998 1433-7851/98/3719-2658 $ 17.50+.50/0 Angew.

Syntheses  of benzylviologen  cyanocuprates(I)  When  an  aqueous  solution  containing  NaCN  and  CuCN  was  mixed  with  an  aqueous  solution  of  ben-  zylviologen dichloride (Aldrich Chemical), a light-brown  crystalline solid was obtained immediately. The reactions  were  carried  out  in  different  BzVC12:CuCN:NaCN  ratios  in  the  range  BzVCI2:CuCN = 0.5-2  and  CuCN:NaCN= 1-3,  but  all the  products exhibited es-  sentially the  same  X-ray  powder  diffraction pattern.  The  composition  of  the  compound  was  (BzV)-  Cu(CN)3-2H20.  Anal.  Calc.  for  CuC27H26N502:  C,  62.83;  H, 5.08; N,  13.57. Found: C, 62.34; H, 4.98;  N,  13.61%.  When [Cu(CN)4] 3-  and BzV were diffused in water  in  a  double-wall  tube,  prismatic  dark-brown  crystals  were grown in a  few weeks in addition to light-brown  fine  crystals.  The  former  crystals  were  suitable  for  a  single-crystal  X-ray  analysis  and  characterized  as  (BzV)3Cu9(CN)15 • H20;  the latter crystals were too thin  for a  single-crystal X-ray analysis.  The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained  by using a Rigaku Geigerflex operated with a DMXAB  computer control system; the radiation was Ni-filtered  C\\'u  Ka.  The  elemental  analyses were  performed  by  Desert Analytics, Tucson, AZ, USA.  2.2.  Single-crystal  X-ray  analysis  of  (BzlO , Cu9( CN) ,s \" HeO  The data collection was performed on a crystal with  dimensions of 0.58 x 0.30 x 0.30  mm by using a  Syntex  P21 diffractometer operated with a Crystal Logics com-  puter  control  system.  The  crystal  data  and  the  data  collection  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  A  numerical  absorption correction based  on  a  psi  scan was made.  The structure was solved by direct methods and all Cu  atoms were located. The remaining atoms were located  in  succeeding difference Fourier syntheses.  For C  and N  atoms in CN groups, a 50/50  averaged  scattering  factor  was  used  at  the  first  stage  of  the  refinement,  and  the  resulting  isotropic  temperature  factors of the C  and N  atoms were examined for each  CN pair. For a CN pair in which the thermal parameters  of the two atoms were almost identical with each other,  it was  assumed that these  atoms were  disordered be-  tween the  two positions.  For a  CN  pair in which the  thermal parameters of the two atoms were significantly  different from each other, the atom with a larger thermal  parameter was temporarily assigned to C and the other  to N,  and succeeding refinements were carried out by  using  the  scattering factors  for  C  and  N  atoms.  For  each  relevant  CN  pair,  the  difference  between  the  isotropic  thermal parameters  of the  C  and  N  atoms,  AB= IB(C)-B(N)I, was  inspected  in  comparison with  the sum of the standard deviations of the parameters,  ]EtrB= trB(c)+ a~(N). For  a  CN  group  with  AB <3Eo\\'~,  the  thermal  parameters  obtained  were  found  to  be  reasonable,  and  the  C  and  the  N  atoms were judged  to  be  ordered.  For  a  CN  pair  with  AB> 3]E~B, the  thermal parameters were judged to be  incorrectly de-  termined  and  hence the  orientation of the  CN group  was regarded  as  disordered;  a  re-calculation was per-  formed for this pair by using again the 50/50 averaged  scattering  factor.  On  the  basis  of this  criterion,  four  of 15 crystallographically nonequivalent CN groups were  disordered: the disordered atoms were named CNa and  CNb.

Cu-CNa  and  Cu-CNb  distances  were  0.02-0.12  A.  Another criterion  reported  for  the  identification of  C  and  N  atoms  in  a  Cu-(CN)-Cu  linkage  is  that  the  Cu-C distance should be about 0.1  A  shorter than the  Cu-N  distance  [23].  This  relation  was  observed  for  almost  all  the  cyano  groups  that  were  judged  to  be  ordered  on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  of  the  thermal  parameters.  In  contrast,  when  the  criterion  based  on  bond distances was applied to the CN groups that were  regarded  as  disordered  on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  of thermal parameters,  all the CN pairs concerned had  unusual thermal parameters in the refinement that was  made with the appropriate scattering factors. Therefore,  the  criterion  based  on  bond  distances  was  not  used  for  the  BzV  complex.  In  the  refinements,  complete  order  or  complete  disorder  was  assumed  for  the  CN  groups.  Disorder  with  an  intermediate  degree  is  also  possible, but such a disorder was not modeled because  of  the  complexity  of  the  structure.  Cu  atoms  and  C  and  N  atoms  in  the  cyano groups  were  anisotropically  refined,  while  the  nonhydrogen  atoms of viologen and a water oxygen atom were refined  isotropically. Hydrogen atoms were not included in the  calculation. All calculations were performed on a VAX  computer  using  MolEN  (Enraf-Nonius)  programs.  3.  Results  and  discussion  Reactions  between  BzV  and  [Cu(CN)x] 1-x  gave  BzVCu(CN)3 • 2H20 ,  in  which  the  ratio  of  Cu:CN:viologen was identical with that of the HV-CuCN  complex.

Cu-CNa  and  Cu-CNb  distances  were  0.02-0.12  A.  Another criterion  reported  for  the  identification of  C  and  N  atoms  in  a  Cu-(CN)-Cu  linkage  is  that  the  Cu-C distance should be about 0.1  A  shorter than the  Cu-N  distance  [23].  This  relation  was  observed  for  almost  all  the  cyano  groups  that  were  judged  to  be  ordered  on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  of  the  thermal  parameters.  In  contrast,  when  the  criterion  based  on  bond distances was applied to the CN groups that were  regarded  as  disordered  on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  of thermal parameters,  all the CN pairs concerned had  unusual thermal parameters in the refinement that was  made with the appropriate scattering factors. Therefore,  the  criterion  based  on  bond  distances  was  not  used  for  the  BzV  complex.  In  the  refinements,  complete  order  or  complete  disorder  was  assumed  for  the  CN  groups.  Disorder  with  an  intermediate  degree  is  also  possible, but such a disorder was not modeled because  of  the  complexity  of  the  structure.  Cu  atoms  and  C  and  N  atoms  in  the  cyano groups  were  anisotropically  refined,  while  the  nonhydrogen  atoms of viologen and a water oxygen atom were refined  isotropically. Hydrogen atoms were not included in the  calculation. All calculations were performed on a VAX  computer  using  MolEN  (Enraf-Nonius)  programs.  3.  Results  and  discussion  Reactions  between  BzV  and  [Cu(CN)x] 1-x  gave  BzVCu(CN)3 • 2H20 ,  in  which  the  ratio  of  Cu:CN:viologen was identical with that of the HV-CuCN  complex.  X-ray  powder  diffraction  demonstrated  that', 'M.B. Inoue  et  al.  /  Inorganica  Chimica Acta  230  (1995)  145-151  the reactions gave a  single product phase  independent  of the ratio of the starting materials used in the reactions;  there  was  no  peak  at  20  values  calculated  from  the  cell  dimensions  of  (BzV)aCug(CN)ls.H20  crystals.  Crystal  growth  by  a  diffusion  method  gave  (BzV)3Cu9(CN)15\" H20,  the  composition of which  was  similar  to  the  composition  (MV)Cua(CN)5  of the  MV  complex. In the course of the crystal growth, the reaction  proceeded very slowly in a solution containing extremely  low  concentrations  of  the  starting  materials.  This  is  probably  the  reason  why  the  diffusion  method  gave  crystals  with  composition  different  from  that  of  the  powder  product  obtained  under  the  usual  reaction  conditions.  The positional parameters of  (BzV)3Cu9(CN)I 5 • H20  are  shown  for  selected  atoms  in  Table  2.  Selected  interatomic  distances  are collected  in  Table  3.  Crystal  packing in the unit cell and the structure of  [Cu9(CN)ls]n  are  shown  in  Figs.  1  and  2,  respectively.  There  are  nine  crystallographically nonequivalent  Cu  atoms.  The  coordination geometries around Cul, Cu4 and Cu7 are  described as distorted tetrahedra  (td). The bond angles  around  a  Cu  atom  with  the  td  coordination  are  100.1-112.5 °  for  Cul,  105.6-122.8 °  for  Cu4  and  104.4-114.8 °  for  Cu7.  The  other  six  Cu  atoms  have  triangular  planar  (tp)  coordination  geometries.  The  maximum  deviation  from  the  least-squares  plane  of  Cu(CN)3  is  0.03  /~  for  Cu2,  0.07  /~  for  Cu3,  0.10  /I,  for Cu5,  0.09/~  for  Cu6,  0.13  /~  for  Cu8  and  0.09/~  for  Cu9.  The  small  deviations  from  the  regular  coor-  dination geometries show that the orbitals of Cu atoms  are  well  defined  by sp 2 or  sp 3 hybridization.  Each  of  the three Cu triads, -Cu2-Cul-Cu3-,  -Cu6-Cu4-Cu5-  and  -Cu9-Cu7-Cu8-,  forms  a  screw parallel  to  the a  axis.  All  screws  consist  of  [-Cu(sp2)-(CN)-Cu(sp3) -  (CN)-Cu(sp2)-(CN)-]n arrays, and are linked with each  other  through  CN  groups,  forming  a  complex  three-  dimensional  network.  There  are  15  crystallographically  nonequivalent  CN  groups,  four of which  are  disordered  on  the  basis  of  the  criterion  described  in  the  Experimental  Section.  All  CN  groups  form  -Cu-(CN)-Cu-  links.  The  CN  bond distances are in the range 1.11-1.19/~. The infrared  spectrum  reflected  the  presence  of a  number  of non-  equivalent CN groups: two C- N stretching bands were  observed  at  2095  and  2105  cm -1,  each  being  accom-  panied  by ill-defined  shoulders.  In  the  -Cu-CN-  network,  the  Cu-C  distances  are  in  the  range  1.88-1.94/~  and  are  independent  of the  coordination  geometry  around  Cu.  In  contrast,  the  Cu(sp2)-N  distances,  1.92-1.98  /~,  are  significantly  shorter  than  Cu(spa)-N  distances,  1.99-2.07  /~.  This  tendency is  also found for the  disordered  CN groups;  three  form  a  Cu(spa)-(CN)-Cu(sp 2)  linkage,  and  the  Cu(sp3)-(CN) distances  are longer  than  Cu(sp2)-(CN)  distances  by  0.07-0.12  /~.  It  has  been  reported  that  Cu(sp)  has  a  Cu-X  distance  shorter  than  the  corre-  sponding  Cu(sp3)-X  [24].  These  tendencies  are  consistent  with  the  general  prediction  M(sp)-X<  M(sp2)-X < M(sp3)-X.  A  water  molecule  is  located  in  a  cavity  formed by  the  -Cu-CN-  network,  and  does  not  form  a  strong  hydrogen bond or a coordination bond: O-C1 = 3.33(2),  O-CN7b = 3.39(2),  O-N8 = 3.39(2),  O-C88 = 3.25(2),  O-C90 = 3.16(2), O-Cul = 3.86(1) and O--Cu4 = 3.75(1)  A.

The -Cu8-C13-N13- linkage  is  located on  the  side  of the  same pyridine ring,  and  C13 forms a close contact with C30 with an interatomic  distance  of 3.27  /~,.

These  C  and  N  atoms  deviate  from  the  molecular  plane  of  the pyridine  ring  and,  consequently,  the  nature  of the  contacts  may be  intermediate  between  a  face  contact  and a side contact. C52, C53 and C61 have side contacts  with  the  inorganic  chains.  The  molecular  plane  of a  pyridine  ring  of viologen  C  is  almost  parallel  to  the  coordination  plane  of Cu6  and  also to  the  plane  con-  sisting of Cul, CN5a, CN5b, Cu3 and CN7a. Significantly  short contacts are present between Cu6 and C87 (3.25  /~),  and  between  C10  and  C90  (3.27  ~k). The  Cu-C  distance  is  practically  identical  with  3.21  and  3.24  /~  reported  for  close  contacts  in  heptylviologen  cyano-  cuprate(I) [16]. Although viologen molecules have close  contacts with the inorganic ions, the pyridine rings  are  not  significantly  deformed.  The  interactions  with  the  inorganic  ions  are  too weak  to  result  in  a  molecular  deformation of a  pyridine  ring,  but are  responsible for  the  deep  color  of the  compound.  A  partial  electron  transfer occurs through these contacts from CN groups  to viologen molecules. The viologen cations have close  contacts  even with  Cu ÷  ions,  as  demonstrated  by the  short  interatomic  distance  between Cu6  and  C87:  the  Cu(I) atom has an electron-donating capability towards  viologen  cations.

This  spectroscopic behavior is similar to  that  of the  MV--CuCN complex  [16].

Froudakis * a Received 15th July 2010, Accepted 29th October 2010 DOI: 10.1039/c0nr00505c The quest for efﬁcient hydrogen storage materials has been the limiting step towards the commercialization of hydrogen as an energy carrier and has attracted a lot of attention from the scientiﬁc community. Sophisticated multi-scale theoretical techniques have been considered as a valuable tool for the prediction of materials storage properties. Such techniques have also been used for the investigation of hydrogen storage in a novel category of porous materials known as Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). These framework materials are consisted of light elements and are characterized by exceptional physicochemical properties such as large surface areas and pore volumes.', 'Combinations of ab initio, Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Grand Canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC) calculations have been performed to investigate the hydrogen adsorption in these ultra-light materials.', 'The purpose of the present review is to summarize the theoretical hydrogen storage studies that have been published after the discovery of COFs. Experimental and theoretical studies have proven that COFs have comparable or better hydrogen storage abilities than other competitive materials such as MOF. The key factors that can lead to the improvement of the hydrogen storage properties of COFs are highlighted, accompanied with some recently presented theoretical multi-scale studies concerning these factors.', 'Introduction Hydrogen storage It is well known that our planet is running out of petroleum resources and a new energy carrier has to be found. In addition the new energy carrier has to be clean and environmentally friendly to prevent pollution. Hydrogen is believed to be an excellent candidate since it is regarded as an ideal energy carrier due to its advantages in comparison with other possible fuels. In particular, it is easy to produce and has high energy content per mass, higher than any other fuel. In addition it is environmentally friendly since the by-product that is produced from its ‘‘burning’’ procedure is mainly water. Nevertheless, one of the main issues that have not allowed commercial use yet has been the difﬁculty of storage. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has set some targets for hydrogen storage tanks in order to be commercialised for automobile applications. These targets for 2015 require that the gravimetric density at the system level a Department of Chemistry, University of Crete, P.O. Box 2208, 71003 Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

We must mention that the above targets correspond to system level capacities and appropriate materials must have higher storage capacities in order to achieve system level targets.', 'Hydrogen can be stored in solid materials by chemisorption or by physisorption. In the ﬁrst case molecular hydrogen dissociates and is stored in atomic form, whereas in the second case hydrogen is stored in the molecular form. Metal hydrides (e.g., LaNi 5 H 6 ,Mg 2 NiH 4 ) and complex hydrides (e.g., alanates, borohydrides, amides) are well known systems for reversible hydrogen storage by chemisorption. The hydrogen can be released by dehydrogenation of the hydride. Conventional metal hydrides provide high reversibility and volumetric capacity but very low gravimetric capacity (<2 wt% for La-based or Ti-based alloys).', '2,3 Light complex hydrides have got higher gravimetric capacities but suffer from low reversibility due to poor hydrogenation–dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics 4,5 e.g.', 'in the case of Mg-based alloys. Chemical hydrates, such as NaAlH 4 , LiBH 4 , and LiAlH 4 , belong to the category of chemisorption materials. These materials preserve potentially good gravimetric and volumetric capacities, but these capacities are limited by the ideal hydrolysis that is required in order to have 100% conversion to hydrogen.', 'Besides chemisorption, the other possible storage mechanism is physisorption. The hydrogen molecule interacts weakly with the surface atoms of the storage material. The interaction energies lay in the order of few kcal mol \\ue6021 , which is at least an order of magnitude less than in the chemisorption case. The interactions can be attributed to dispersive and weak electrostatic forces.', 'In the recent past, considerable interest was focused on carbon-based materials 6–9 like fullerenes, nanoﬁbres, and nanotubes 10 for hydrogen storage. The large surface area and pore volume of these materials together with their advanced structural stability made them good adsorbent candidates. For conventional porous carbon, the hydrogen uptake is proportional to its surface area and pore volume. In addition, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which have diameters of typically a few nanometres, were suggested as suitable materials for gas storage.', '11–13 Despite the fact that a lot of scientiﬁc effort was dedicated to these directions, the results both in experimental and in theoretical terms did not conﬁrm the original enthusiasm.', 'From the very beginning it was expected that large surface area will promote storage by physisorption. Following this trivial idea, most of the research was focused on the porous materials that possess large surface area by design. Due to their superior structural formation, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as hydrogen storage materials upon their discovery. They are synthesized from metal or metal oxide vertexes interconnected by organic linkers. These materials were initially discovered by Yaghi and co-workers 14,15 and form 3-dimensional networks of very high porosity. A variety of linker molecules can be used to create an entire family of materials having different pore sizes and containing different chemical functionalities within the linkers but all with the same basic framework topology. In addition, different metal corners and different organic linkers can yield a wide variety of other framework topologies.', '16–20 In many cases these materials fulﬁlled the expectations. Various experimental and theoretical studies 21–25 have shown impressive storage capacity of several MOFs at low temperature and high pressure. However, the storage capacity obtained at ambient temperature and pressure is still far from the DOE targets.', '2D and 3D COFs Theoretical and experimental studies on gas adsorption in MOF materials, which combine large surface area, aromaticity and metal sites, has led to some useful conclusions that will help the quest of the ideal storage material. The existence of metal atoms should be accompanied with exposed metal sites. Otherwise, they add weight in the structure without increasing the storage capacity, which is the case in most of MOFs. Studies have shown that the metal clusters, despite what it was believed in the beginning, had similar hydrogen binding strength with the organic linkers while the latter are much lighter.', '26,27 An obvious improvement in the gravimetric capacity of these nanoporous materials (MOFs) would possibly come from substituting the metal cluster with another lighter building block or by discovering a novel family of materials that will exhibit the large surface area and the aromaticity of the organic linkers that MOFs have, but without the drawback of the presence of heavy unexposed metals. That new family of materials which fulﬁls some of the previous demands was synthesized, again, by Yaghi and co-workers, 28 namely, three-dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks (3D-COFs).', 'The 3D-COFs were synthesized by targeting two nets based on triangular and tetrahedral nodes: ctn and bor. These materials are entirely constructed from strong covalent bonds (C–C, C–O, C–B, and B–O) and have high surface areas (4210 m 2 g \\ue6021 for COF-103) and extremely low densities (0.17 g cm \\ue6023 for COF108). From the ﬁrst look, COFs present all the advantages of MOFs considering hydrogen storage (surface area, pore volume, rigidity of the structure) while the light elements that construct their molecular framework lower the relative weight of the structure, compared with that of the MOFs. For these reasons, COF materials have recently attracted attention as hydrogen storage materials.', 'George E: Froudakis George E. Froudakis was born in Iraklion of Crete, Greece (1968) and began his studies in Physics at the University of Crete where he graduates his BSc (1990). During his PhD (1995) he studied the structure and stability of low symmetry semiconductor clusters. He joined the Chemistry Department of Crete University in 2001 where he teaches Computational and Quantum Chemistry. His research concerns ab initio and multi-scale theoretical calculations in nanomaterials. The last few years his main interest is in designing novel nano-materials suitable for hydrogen storage.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Nanoscale, 2011, 3, 856–869 | 857 Published on 07 January 2011.

They can be very helpful by explaining what is happening in the experiments but also they can guide expensive, difﬁcult and time consuming experimental studies. Improved and technically accurate multiscale computational techniques can perform experiments in silico with outstanding accuracy.', '30,31 The application of such methods for the investigation of the hydrogen storage properties of nano-materials has been identiﬁed as crucial to the direction of ﬁnding an efﬁcient solution to the hydrogen storage problem.', '32–35 The basic categories of computational methods that can be used in the study of molecular systems are quantum mechanic calculations and simulations based on classical physics. Quantum chemistry (QM) methods, called ab initio, do not enforce any parameters to the system but solve the Schr € odinger equation by ﬁrst principles. The great advantage of the ab initio methods is that they can provide structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of the system with high accuracy. On the other hand, their computational cost increases dramatically with the number of the electrons of the system. Ab initio methods are used mainly to investigate the energetics of the interaction that can exist between hydrogen and the adsorbent. Such calculations result in the knowledge of the interaction strength, the nature of the interactions of hydrogen with the pore walls and provide the available binding sites in the material.', 'Classical simulations offer the possibility to measure the hydrogen adsorption capacity of nano-structures under different thermodynamic conditions. In this way we can predict absorption isotherms and compare directly with the experiment.', '30,31 These simulations include several types of calculations like Monte Carlo (MC), Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Molecular Mechanics (MM). The great advantage of these methods is their ability to treat larger systems since they are computationally inexpensive compared with the ab initio methods. Furthermore, they can take into consideration the pressure and temperature dependence of the simulations. The major disadvantage of the classical simulations is that their results and their accuracy depend on parameters.', 'It is clear from the previous analysis of quantum and classical approaches that both have strong advantages together with critical disadvantages. Over the last few years, a new methodology is developed trying to combine the large size of the systems with the desired accuracy without ending up in prohibitively large calculations. It is based on a multi-scale methodology and it is schematically presented in Fig. 1.', 'The 1 st scale consists of the minimum parts of the COF skeleton, the building units. There we can apply very accurate ab initio methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT), M € oller– Plesset (MP) and Couple Cluster (CC) for calculating the binding of the hydrogen molecules. The 2 nd scale contains larger molecular models (more than 50 atoms) or a unit cell of the periodic structure where Density Functional Theory (DFT) or mixed methods involving QM and MM (QM/MM) can be applied.', 'From these 2 scales we can predict all the necessary information for ﬁtting an ab initio based interatomic potential describing the interaction between the hydrogen molecule and the COF pore.', 'Then we can perform classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations at the 3 rd scale, taking into account thousands of atoms. In our case, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations can reproduce isotherms for hydrogen adsorption under different thermodynamic conditions that can be compared directly to the experiment.', 'Ab initio The quantum mechanical methods used for calculating the binding energy of H 2 to the framework are generally based on Density Functional Theory or M € oller–Plesset perturbation theory. DFT has the advantage of low computational cost together with the disadvantage of questionable accuracy when treating weak interactions. ‘‘Classical’’ functionals like PBE and PW91 claim to treat the weak interactions fairly.', '36,37 In any case, direct comparison with at least MP2 is performed in most of the studies for evaluating the accuracy of binding energies of DFT in each particular system. Nevertheless in many cases DFT methods describe well the trends in binding energies in such systems. New approaches in DFT that include nonempirical 38 or empirical 39 corrections for the dispersion interactions in existing functionals seem very promising in predicting more accurately the energetics in hydrogen interaction with the host material.', 'To calculate the interaction potential of the hydrogen molecule with framework materials accurate ab initio methods like MP2 or even CC are used. This part of the multi-scale treatment is the most critical since all the classical calculations that will follow are very sensitive to the interatomic potentials. For this study we need to separate each part of the framework from its environment and treat it as individual cluster. In this way very accurate ab initio methods can be applied and the Potential Energy Surface (PES) of the interaction with hydrogen can be scanned.', 'The tricky part is the termination of the remaining cluster that has to be done in a way that will represent sufﬁciently the missing environment.', 'Grand canonical Monte Carlo method In material science, classical Monte Carlo simulations have been found to be a very important and widely used tool 40,41 taking into account thousands of atoms and producing results that can be directly compared with the experiment. Among the various ensembles that MC simulations 42,43 adopt for the description of the system under study, the grand canonical ensemble (GCMC) is the one most widely used for adsorption studies since it is the only one that allows the total number of particles, N, to vary.', 'According to this ensemble, the chemical potential, m, the volume, V, and the temperature, T, are kept constant ((m,V,T) ensemble), while the number of the molecules, N, is allowed to ﬂuctuate.

At frequent time intervals and after equilibrium is reached, a ghost atom is randomly inserted into the system and the energy change due to the insertion is used for the calculation of the chemical potential for the thermodynamic state under examination.', 'During the GCMC simulations, three types of trial moves are attempted i.e., particle creation at a randomly chosen position, randomly chosen particle destruction and randomly chosen particle displacement and/or rotation. Due to particle creation and destruction, the number of particles, N, within the pore ﬂuctuates. For each trial, if the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the system is of lower energy than the previous, the move is accepted. In the opposite case, the energy difference of the conﬁgurations before and after the trial move is used for the calculation of the possibility of accepting the trial move.', 'The correct form of the function that describes the interactions between the particles of our system is a key point of this method.', 'The common practice in that kind of simulations is to take into consideration the interactions of the atoms between the sorbate molecules and between the sorbate and solid atoms. The interactions between the atoms of the solid itself are not taken into consideration since they are assumed to be frozen.', 'A variety of potential functions are well known 46–50 for describing the Van der Waals interactions.

According to this potential the interaction energy between two non-bonded atoms i and j can expressed be as follows: U ij ¼ 43 ij \\ue602 s ij r ij \\ue603 12 \\ue602 \\ue602 s ij r ij \\ue603 6 \"# where 3 ij is the potential well depth and s ij the interatomic distance at which a zero potential energy occurs. The whole set of these parameters used for these studies can be either taken from literature 51–55 or calculated speciﬁcally for each case. Once the potential parameters, s and 3, for a given atom type have been calculated, mixing rules can be applied for the calculations of these parameters for a pair of heteroatoms.', 'Another function that describes the potential between sorbate and framework atoms that has extensively been used is the Morse potential: U ij ¼ D ij e \\ue602g ij r ij r e;ij \\ue602 1 \\ue602\\ue603 \\ue602 2e \\ue602 g ij 2 r ij r e;ij \\ue602 1 \\ue602\\ue603 2 6 4 3 7 5 where D ij is the well depth, g ij is the stiffness parameter that deﬁnes the well shape and r e,ij is the equilibrium distance.', 'Besides the interatomic potential that will be used another point of debate is the necessity or not of using quantum corrections to the simulation. The quantum correction enlarges the effective diameter of a molecule in comparison to its classical counterpart and therefore reduces the adsorption ability of nanopores. The approach often used to describe the quantum effects during Monte Carlo simulations is based on the Feynman–Hibbs effective potential.', '56 According to this approach, the effective potential is described by U FH ¼ U cl þ \\ue602 Z 2 24mk B T \\ue603 V 2 U cl where m is the reduced mass of the pair of interacting species and U cl is the classical potential used for the description of the interactions between the pair of species.', 'In addition to the Van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions have been proven to play signiﬁcant role in the interaction energy of the system. This is due to the fact that adsorbates may either have permanent dipole moment due to partial charges on their atoms or be easily polarized molecules. In both cases the electrostatic terms of the potential cannot be regarded as negligible. The electrostatic interactions are usually described by ordinary Coulomb potential.', 'Hydrogen storage in COF Interaction sites vs. energy The 1 st part of a multi-scale treatment of hydrogen storage in COFs is to ﬁnd the interaction sites of the framework and calculate the relative binding energies. Due to the large size of COF cells, the model system must be reduced in size in order to perform accurate ab initio calculations. One way to achieve the reduction of the size is by using the supramolecular approach which was used by Klontzas et al.', '30 They studied B 3 O 3 ,C 2 O 2 B and phenyl rings that can be found in the structure of the four different 3D COFs (102, 103, 105, and 108) by selecting a unique molecular model for the representation of the phenyl ring (model A, Fig. 2) and two different models for the representation of the Fig. 1 Multi-scale methodology scheme, showing the different levels of theory and the corresponding size of systems under study.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Nanoscale, 2011, 3, 856–869 | 859 Published on 07 January 2011.

The number of the molecular models that were adopted depended also on the computational method (model B for DFT and model C for MP2 respectively). The smaller model was chosen for the MP2 calculations due to the higher computational cost of the perturbation theory. For C 2 O 2 B rings, the model D shown in Fig. 2 was selected. Both the perpendicular and parallel approaching orientations of the H 2 molecule (with respect to the ring plane) for each binding site were examined. In the case of model A, they chose to examine only the model similar to the tetrahedral tetra(4-dihydroxyborylphenyl)methane (TBPM) building block (with the tetrahedral carbon atom) instead of the silane analogue because the selection of the tetrahedral atom would have minor effect on the calculated binding energies.

The energetically most favourable sites were located over the center of the phenyl rings when hydrogen approaches with a perpendicular orientation. Binding over B 3 O 3 ring was favourable over the center of the ring and over B atom with similar binding energies and with the parallel approaching orientation for H 2 . In the case of C 2 O 2 B rings binding energies were comparable to those on the center of the phenyl ring, with the parallel approaching orientation of H 2 over the center of ring to be favoured. A comparison of these binding energies with those calculated in previous studies for IRMOFs 26,27 showed that no major discrepancies existed. So the authors concluded that the binding energies were not the major reason for an increased hydrogen adsorption in 3D COFs.', 'The analysis of the hydrogen binding sites presented in the previous paragraph showed that COFs did not offer considerably stronger binding in comparison with reported values in IRMOFs.', 'That was the reason for which they expected that COFs and MOFs with comparable surface areas would accommodate similar amounts of hydrogen, resulting in analogous volumetric uptake.

The interactions of hydrogen with the building moieties of COF are dominated by weak van Waals and dispersion interactions and by weak electrostatic interactions between the permanent quadrupole moments of hydrogen with the framework.', 'Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation A series of studies have been performed by many research groups in an effort to quantify the performance of COFs in adsorbing hydrogen. All the results from that kind of studies indicate that these materials are very promising candidates for hydrogen storage. In fact, the so far reported gravimetric uptake of hydrogen from COFs exceeds the level of exotic 20 wt% in some cases, rendering them among the best performing materials studied for hydrogen storage applications. This uptake is almost 4 times larger than the 2015 DOE system target for automotive applications. From the volumetric point of view almost all 3DCOF materials perform well, reaching a maximum 45 g l \\ue6021 in the case of COF-102.', 'Following a multi-scale theoretical approach Klontzas et al.', '30 studied hydrogen adsorption from a series of 3D-COFs, i.e.', 'COF-102, 103, 105, 108 and found extraordinary gravimetric uptakes for these materials. This multi-scale methodology offers the advantage of ﬁxing the potential parameters to describe better the system under examination. This is achieved when the classical potential is able to calculate correctly the energetics of our systems, as have already determined from ﬁrst principles calculations. Potential parameters are determined by scanning the hydrogen binding energy at different distances from the framework. This energy is calculated at the MP2 level of theory and afterwards the parameters of the potential are chosen in such way to be able to reproduce the energy taken from ab initio calculations. Following this approach, the classical potential is sensitive to the particularities of the system under examination and it is avoided the use of identical set of potential parameters for all the different studies.', 'Especially for COF-108, as it can be seen in Fig. 3, Monte Carlo simulations at cryogenic temperature showed that this material exhibits almost 21 wt%, whereas at ambient temperature the very promising value of 4.5 wt% was reached.

This performance was attributed to the topological characteristics of these materials since they possess large pore volume and this becomes a disadvantage when we consider the volumetric uptake leading to poor performance. The chemical reason for this observation is the fact that for materials of large free volume, the solid–ﬂuid potential energy gain is not enough to result in a sizable excess adsorption. This disadvantage has also been noticed in the case of hydrogen adsorption on other large-pore COFs and MOFs.', '66–68 The above observations can also justify the different behavior between COF-102, COF-103 vs. COF-105, COF-108.

This is not the case for the diffusion along the pores in 2D-COFs. The existence of large potential barriers highly hinders the motion along the pores. As consequence diffusion in this direction takes place by jumps separated by quite long residence times, making the procedure slower.', 'The reduced ability of 2D-COF to adsorb hydrogen in comparison to the corresponding 3D-COF was also veriﬁed by Yang and Zhong 77 who performed GCMC simulations in order to investigate the adsorption behavior of CO 2 ,CH 4 and H 2 in two 2D-COFs with different pore size, namely COF-8 and COF-10.', 'Comparison with experimental results and MOFs Garberoglio 69 compared the adsorption performance of MOFs and COFs.

The major reason for their high hydrogen uptake is the special characteristics of the materials such as low density, high surface area, pore size, and framework topology rather than the existence of enhanced interaction sites in the pore surface. A further step to achieve improved storage capacity in these materials is the introduction of charged species on the pore surface. This strategy has been also used successfully in the past, both in carbon-based materials and MOFs to improve their storage capabilities.', '32–34,78–80 This improvement was achieved through the introduction of lithium ions in the material.', 'Hydrogen interacts with the lithium ion through charge induced dipole with quadruple moment contributions.

Similar enhancement was observed also for volumetric capacity.', 'Nevertheless, the capacities were found to be lower than the corresponding Li doped 3D COF in the study of Cao et al., where the authors attributed this difference mainly to the different physicochemical characteristics (e.g., free volume, framework density) of these materials.', 'Choi et al.', '84 explored hydrogen storage mechanisms on pure and Li + - and Mg 2+ -decorated COFs via ﬁrst principles calculations. It was found that Li + -decorated material could adsorb up to 3 dihydrogen molecules while the average interaction energy per adsorbed molecule was found to be 6.45 kcal mol \\ue6021 . The Mg 2+ -doped material adsorbed up to 6 molecules (twice the number determined in the case of Li + ), with average interaction energy of 6.91 kcal mol \\ue6021 per adsorbed molecule. The authors also estimated the saturation values of gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities at room temperature and reasonable pressures using a method proposed by Sagara et al., 85 i.e. by counting the number of hydrogen molecules effectively adsorbed on each metal ion in the unit cell of COF-108. In this way the calculated maximum saturation values of hydrogen sorption capacity were 6.5 and 6.8 wt%, for Li + - and Mg 2+ - decorated COF-108s, respectively.', 'Functionalization. Li doping proved to be an effective way for the improvement of hydrogen uptake of framework structures but this strategy presents severe experimental difﬁculties when applied in MOFs. An experimentally feasible way of incorporating Li is by forming ionic bonds between lithium and functional groups of the organic linker. In this case, lithium can interact with multiple hydrogen molecules as in the doped case Fig. 6 H 2 adsorption isotherms for Li-doped COFs at T ¼ 298 K. (a) Total gravimetric isotherms.

This methodology has been initially applied theoretically in MOFs 33 and there was experimental evidence for the formation of lithium alkoxide groups in MOF 86–88 and MIL (Materiaux Institut Lavoisier) 89 conﬁrming the validity of the strategy.', 'Klontzas et al.', '90 applied this strategy to improve the storage capacity by introducing into the 3D-COF structures lithium alkoxide groups. Three lithium alkoxide groups were added in every HHTP building unit and the functionalized building block is presented in Fig. 7. Then a multiscale theoretical study was performed to evaluate the hydrogen storage capacity of the modiﬁed COF-105. Initially, DFT calculations showed that up to ﬁve H 2 can interact directly with the lithium alkoxide group.', 'The ﬁrst H 2 interact with Li, and the interaction energy was calculated to be 2.95 kcal mol \\ue6021 , a value that is almost three times larger than the interaction of H 2 with the unmodiﬁed material.', 'Then the H 2 storage capacity of the modiﬁed COF-105 was studied by performing GCMC simulations at 77 and 300 K for pressures up to 100 bars. As it can be clearly seen from Fig. 8 it was found that the proposed structure functionalization led to signiﬁcant improvement of hydrogen uptake in both gravimetric and volumetric terms. The effect of the functionalization was more pronounced for the volumetric uptake than the gravimetric. The reason for this is that the proposed modiﬁcation with the –OLi group increased the weight of the material, since a single hydrogen molecule of the framework is substituted by a group of signiﬁcantly larger weight. This was not the case for the volumetric uptake since the system volume does not change upon the structural modiﬁcation. In addition the improvement of the uptake was more important for the low loading range, where the modiﬁed COF-105 reaches the DOE target for gravimetric uptake even at room temperature.', 'Li et al.', '91 proposed a new way for improving hydrogen storage in COFs by substitutional doping of the bridge C 2 O 2 B rings with different metal-participated rings. In this way, they aimed at avoiding the clustering of metal atoms. First-principles calculations on both crystalline phase and molecular fragments showed that the H 2 binding energy can be signiﬁcantly enhanced. In particular for the N 2 Al and Mg 2 N doped COF-108 crystals the binding energies approached 2.39 kcal mol \\ue6021 (almost three times more than in the pure crystal), which would be beneﬁcial for efﬁcient hydrogen storage at ambient temperatures. The isotherms obtained from GCMC simulations further conﬁrmed that such substitutional doping would improve the room temperature hydrogen storage performance by a factor of two to three since it enabled reaching values up to 2.73 wt% in the Mg 2 N doped crystal.', 'Fig. 7 Optimized molecular model of the lithium alkoxide modiﬁed HHTP building unit; carbon, silicon, oxygen, boron, hydrogen, and lithium atoms are shown as gray, yellow, red, pink, white, and purple colors, respectively.', 'Fig. 8 Gravimetric and volumetric isotherms of hydrogen adsorption at 77 and 300 K for original and OLi group modiﬁed COF-105.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Nanoscale, 2011, 3, 856–869 | 865 Published on 07 January 2011.

In a recent study, Klontzas et al.', '66 proposed four novel 3D-COF structures with enhanced storage performance.', 'They all come from COF-102 by carrying out the appropriate structural changes in such a way that their storage properties would be superior to the parent framework. Particularly, they substituted the phenylene moieties of COF-102 with the more extended diphenyl, triphenyl, napthalene, and pyrene aromatic moieties, without changing the net topology creating in this way the so-called COF-102-2, COF-102-3, COF-102-4, and COF102-5 (Fig. 9). The construction of the initial crystal structures was followed by an optimization procedure, using molecular mechanics methods. The resulting building units and COF structures are presented in Fig. 9. After the optimization of these new structures, GCMC simulations were used to obtain the total gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen uptake at 77 K and room temperature for pressures up to 100 bar. The results of these simulations can be seen in Fig. 10.', 'All the proposed structures showed enhanced gravimetric capacity with respect to the corresponding gravimetric uptake of the parent COF-102 structure, both at cryogenic and room temperature. COF-102-3 showed the best performance and reached 26.7 and 6.5 wt% at 77 and 300 K, respectively at 100 bar, values that exceed the DOE target of 5.5 wt% even at room temperature. On the other hand, the proposed materials showed lower volumetric performance than COF-102. This was attributed to the larger pore volume that they possess, i.e. 94%, 89%, 87%, 83% and 76% for COF-102-3, COF-102-2, COF-102-5, COF-102-4 and COF-102, respectively. As it can be seen, the order of the materials in terms of free volume is the same as in terms of maximum gravimetric uptake. On the contrary, in terms of volumetric uptake that order is reversed. Indeed, from the volumetric point of view, very large pores result in empty space inside the material, which is dominated by weak ﬂuid–ﬂuid interactions.', 'Hydrogen storage in COF by spillover Another approach that has attracted a lot of attention has been the hydrogen storage by spillover. The spillover effect on Fig. 9 The different organic moieties that have been used for the construction of the COF materials. By using the same topology as COF102 and the same connectivity and alternating the organic moieties there have been constructed a series of periodic COF cells ranging from COF102 to COF-102-5.

Experimental data have shown that spillover can enhance hydrogen storage in bridged porous carbon, MOF and COF materials by 2–3 times compared with the pristine materials.', '92,93 It has been proposed that hydrogen dissociate over metal catalyst and then can be diffused from the supporting substrate to the adsorptive material through oxygenrich bridging materials (this material acts as ‘‘glue’’). Suri et al.', '94 performed an ab initio study to ﬁnd the hydrogen capacity of COF-1. They concluded that 1H atom per carbon atom of the benzene molecule could be bound with an average binding energy of 2.41 eV. No hydrogen was bound on B 3 O 3 rings. In this way they predicted a saturation storage density of 4.5 wt% for COF-1.', 'Conclusions COF materials have been considered as candidate materials for hydrogen storage. Especially 3D-COFs due to their unique characteristics exhibit excellent performance especially at 77 K, where COF-108 exceeded 20 wt% storage capacity at 100 bar. On the other hand, COF performance at ambient pressure and temperature is quite low and similar to other MOFs. In order to enhance their storage capabilities, strategies such as doping with alkali atoms or functionalization of the organic moieties have been applied. These strategies led to a clear enhancement of the amount of hydrogen that can be stored in the modiﬁed 3D-COF, exceeding in some cases the established target of 6 wt% at ambient temperature. Further work shall be focused on the introduction of stronger interaction sites in COF materials, since their physicochemical characteristics such as surface area and free volume are already among the highest.', 'In parallel the validity of multiscale theoretical approaches for predicting the adsorption characteristics of COF materials has been well established based on the observed agreement with the experimental data. Such approaches can contribute toward the targeted synthesis of new COF materials which have been predicted to give even higher performances in terms of hydrogen storage capability.', 'References 1 Hydrogen, Fuel Cells & Infrastructure Technologies Program: Multiyear Research, Development and Demonstration Plan: Planned program activities for 2003–2010, United States Department of Energy, 2005, ch. 3.3, Revision 1, http://www1.eere.energy.gov/ hydrogenandfuelcells/mypp/pdfs/storage.pdf.', '2 L.

Sophisticated multi-scale theoretical techniques have been considered as a valuable tool for the prediction of materials storage properties.

       "  'Introduction Hydrogen storage It is well known that our planet is running out of petroleum resources and a new energy carrier has to be found. In addition the new energy carrier has to be clean and environmentally friendly to prevent pollution. Hydrogen is believed to be an excellent candidate since it is regarded as an ideal energy carrier due to its advantages in comparison with other possible fuels. In particular, it is easy to produce and has high energy content per mass, higher than any other fuel. In addition it is environmentally friendly since the by-product that is produced from its ‘‘burning’’ procedure is mainly water. Nevertheless, one of the main issues that have not allowed commercial use yet has been the difﬁculty of storage. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has set some targets for hydrogen storage tanks in order to be commercialised for automobile applications.

       "  'Hydrogen can be stored in solid materials by chemisorption or by physisorption. In the ﬁrst case molecular hydrogen dissociates and is stored in atomic form, whereas in the second case hydrogen is stored in the molecular form. Metal hydrides (e.g., LaNi 5 H 6 ,Mg 2 NiH 4 ) and complex hydrides (e.g., alanates, borohydrides, amides) are well known systems for reversible hydrogen storage by chemisorption. The hydrogen can be released by dehydrogenation of the hydride. Conventional metal hydrides provide high reversibility and volumetric capacity but very low gravimetric capacity (<2 wt% for La-based or Ti-based alloys).',\n",
       "  '2,3 Light complex hydrides have got higher gravimetric capacities but suffer from low reversibility due to poor hydrogenation–dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics 4,5 e.g.',\n",
       "  'in the case of Mg-based alloys. Chemical hydrates, such as NaAlH 4 , LiBH 4 , and LiAlH 4 , belong to the category of chemisorption materials. These materials preserve potentially good gravimetric and volumetric capacities, but these capacities are limited by the ideal hydrolysis that is required in order to have 100% conversion to hydrogen.',\n",
       "  'Besides chemisorption, the other possible storage mechanism is physisorption. The hydrogen molecule interacts weakly with the surface atoms of the storage material. The interaction energies lay in the order of few kcal mol \\ue6021 , which is at least an order of magnitude less than in the chemisorption case. The interactions can be attributed to dispersive and weak electrostatic forces.',\n",
       "  'In the recent past, considerable interest was focused on carbon-based materials 6–9 like fullerenes, nanoﬁbres, and nanotubes 10 for hydrogen storage. The large surface area and pore volume of these materials together with their advanced structural stability made them good adsorbent candidates. For conventional porous carbon, the hydrogen uptake is proportional to its surface area and pore volume. In addition, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which have diameters of typically a few nanometres, were suggested as suitable materials for gas storage.',\n",
       "  '11–13 Despite the fact that a lot of scientiﬁc effort was dedicated to these directions, the results both in experimental and in theoretical terms did not conﬁrm the original enthusiasm.',\n",
       "  'From the very beginning it was expected that large surface area will promote storage by physisorption. Following this trivial idea, most of the research was focused on the porous materials that possess large surface area by design. Due to their superior structural formation, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as hydrogen storage materials upon their discovery. They are synthesized from metal or metal oxide vertexes interconnected by organic linkers. These materials were initially discovered by Yaghi and co-workers 14,15 and form 3-dimensional networks of very high porosity. A variety of linker molecules can be used to create an entire family of materials having different pore sizes and containing different chemical functionalities within the linkers but all with the same basic framework topology. In addition, different metal corners and different organic linkers can yield a wide variety of other framework topologies.',\n",
       "  '16–20 In many cases these materials fulﬁlled the expectations. Various experimental and theoretical studies 21–25 have shown impressive storage capacity of several MOFs at low temperature and high pressure. However, the storage capacity obtained at ambient temperature and pressure is still far from the DOE targets.',\n",
       "  '2D and 3D COFs Theoretical and experimental studies on gas adsorption in MOF materials, which combine large surface area, aromaticity and metal sites, has led to some useful conclusions that will help the quest of the ideal storage material. The existence of metal atoms should be accompanied with exposed metal sites. Otherwise, they add weight in the structure without increasing the storage capacity, which is the case in most of MOFs. Studies have shown that the metal clusters, despite what it was believed in the beginning, had similar hydrogen binding strength with the organic linkers while the latter are much lighter.',\n",
       "  '26,27 An obvious improvement in the gravimetric capacity of these nanoporous materials (MOFs) would possibly come from substituting the metal cluster with another lighter building block or by discovering a novel family of materials that will exhibit the large surface area and the aromaticity of the organic linkers that MOFs have, but without the drawback of the presence of heavy unexposed metals. That new family of materials which fulﬁls some of the previous demands was synthesized, again, by Yaghi and co-workers, 28 namely, three-dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks (3D-COFs).',\n",
       "  'The 3D-COFs were synthesized by targeting two nets based on triangular and tetrahedral nodes: ctn and bor. These materials are entirely constructed from strong covalent bonds (C–C, C–O, C–B, and B–O) and have high surface areas (4210 m 2 g \\ue6021 for COF-103) and extremely low densities (0.17 g cm \\ue6023 for COF108). From the ﬁrst look, COFs present all the advantages of MOFs considering hydrogen storage (surface area, pore volume, rigidity of the structure) while the light elements that construct their molecular framework lower the relative weight of the structure, compared with that of the MOFs. For these reasons, COF materials have recently attracted attention as hydrogen storage materials.',\n",

Quantum chemistry (QM) methods, called ab initio, do not enforce any parameters to the system but solve the Schr € odinger equation by ﬁrst principles. The great advantage of the ab initio methods is that they can provide structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of the system with high accuracy. On the other hand, their computational cost increases dramatically with the number of the electrons of the system. Ab initio methods are used mainly to investigate the energetics of the interaction that can exist between hydrogen and the adsorbent. Such calculations result in the knowledge of the interaction strength, the nature of the interactions of hydrogen with the pore walls and provide the available binding sites in the material.',\n",

The great advantage of these methods is their ability to treat larger systems since they are computationally inexpensive compared with the ab initio methods. Furthermore, they can take into consideration the pressure and temperature dependence of the simulations. The major disadvantage of the classical simulations is that their results and their accuracy depend on parameters.',\n",

As it has been clearly noted in this text 3DCOFs have been proved to be very good candidates for hydrogen storage.

A further step to achieve improved storage capacity in these materials is the introduction of charged species on the pore surface. This strategy has been also used successfully in the past, both in carbon-based materials and MOFs to improve their storage capabilities.',\n",
