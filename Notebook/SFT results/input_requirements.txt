You are a materials scientist and your task is to design MOFs materials to meet the specific hydrogen storage properties UG at 77k 100bar to 160k 5bar operating conditions. Hydrogen storage performance UG is divided into five types: Bad, Poor, Average, Good, Excellent, they correspond to the UG performance values of (0-9.775), (9.776-14.63), (14.63-19.69), (19.69-25.91), and (25.91-60), respectively, in wt%. MOFs consists of metal nodes, organic nodes and organic edges according to certain topological laws. Organic nodes and organic edges together constitute the majority of MOFs ligands, while metal nodes represent clusters of metal nuclei containing partial distributors. I have given you two lists, one with information on metal nodes, organic nodes, and organic edges, through which you can learn some key information and properties, and the second with a list of performance evaluations of MOFs with a small number of these three building blocks, which you can use to predict and select the right building blocks.
