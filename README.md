- Successful synthesis of Cu-LLMs-1 (1.33 wt% capacity at RT)

## ğŸ“Œ Core Innovation
We present **MOFs-LLM**, the first vertical LLM for metal-organic frameworks that:
1. **Understands** complex MOF characteristics across electronic/atomic/structural hierarchies
2. **Predicts** hydrogen storage performance with 94.8% accuracy
3. **Designs** synthesizable MOF structures through reverse design
4. **Guides** experimental synthesis with actionable recommendations

## ğŸ§  Technical Foundation

## Overview
This repository presents MOFs-LLM, the first domain-specific large language model for inverse design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with both high hydrogen storage capacity and experimental synthesizability. Our work addresses two critical challenges in MOF research:
1. Bridging the gap between hypothetical structures and experimentally viable materials
2. Simultaneously optimizing hydrogen storage performance and synthetic feasibility

## Key Innovations
- â€‹**Domain-Specialized LLM**: 210M-token MOF corpus integrating structural descriptions, synthesis protocols, and performance data
- â€‹**Dual Optimization**: Achieves 94.8% prediction accuracy for hydrogen storage while maintaining synthesizability
- â€‹**Experimental Validation**: Successfully synthesized Cu-LLMs-1 with 1.33 wt% room-temperature hydrogen adsorption (top 5 among pure MOFs)

## Methodology
### Training Pipeline
![Training Flowchart](https://github.com/cgarls/MOFs-LLM/raw/main/Pictures/Flow%20chart.png)

1. â€‹**Post-Pretraining**:
   - Domain adaptation of ERNIE model using comprehensive MOF corpus
   - Captures hierarchical structural features (metal centers, ligands, topologies)

2. â€‹**Supervised Fine-Tuning**:
   - Multi-task learning for hydrogen capacity prediction and synthesis feasibility
   - Incorporates expert knowledge from 6,000+ research papers

3. â€‹**Inverse Design**:
   - Conditional generation of novel MOF structures
   - Experimental feedback loop for synthesis optimization

## From Virtual to Reality

Our framework demonstrates:
- â€‹**3 experimental iterations** to identify optimal synthesis conditions
- â€‹**1.33 wt% hydrogen capacity** at room temperature
- â€‹**Top 5 performance** among pure MOF materials

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- Transformers library

### Basic Usage
```python
from mofs_llm import MOFsLLMPipeline

# Load pretrained model
designer = MOFsLLMPipeline.from_pretrained("MOFs-LLM-base")

# Generate MOF candidates
target_properties = {"H2_capacity": ">1.2wt%", "temperature": "298K"}
candidates = designer.inverse_design(target_properties)
