# MOFs-LLM: Bridging Virtual to Real through Inverse Design of MOFs for Hydrogen Storage

## üåü Breakthrough Research
**First domain-customized LLM for MOFs** achieving:
- 94.8% accuracy in hydrogen storage prediction
- Successful synthesis of Cu-LLMs-1 (1.33 wt% capacity at RT)
- 3x faster experimental validation cycles

## üìå Core Innovation
We present **MOFs-LLM**, the first vertical LLM for metal-organic frameworks that:
1. **Understands** complex MOF characteristics across electronic/atomic/structural hierarchies
2. **Predicts** hydrogen storage performance with 94.8% accuracy
3. **Designs** synthesizable MOF structures through inverse design
4. **Guides** experimental synthesis with actionable recommendations

## üß† Technical Foundation
### Domain-Specific Pretraining
- **Corpus**: 210M+ tokens covering 15,000 MOF structures
- **Knowledge Integration**: 
  - 6,000+ research papers 
  - Experimental synthesis protocols
  - Structure-property relationships
- **Model Architecture**: ERNIE-based post-training

### Key Capabilities

##üèÜ Impact
###Transforms MOF development by:
- Closing the design-synthesis gap
- Democratizing access to high-performance MOF design
- Establishing blueprint for other materials domains

## Results
MOFs-LLM achieved a **94.8% prediction accuracy** for hydrogen storage properties and successfully assisted in the synthesis of a top-performing MOF material (1.3 wt% storage at room temperature).
