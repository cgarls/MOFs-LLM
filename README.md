## ðŸŒŸ Breakthrough Research
**Domain-customized LLM for MOFs** achieving:
- 94.8% accuracy in hydrogen storage prediction
- Successful synthesis of Cu-LLMs-1 (1.33 wt% capacity at RT)

## ðŸ“Œ Core Innovation
We present **MOFs-LLM**, the first vertical LLM for metal-organic frameworks that:
1. **Understands** complex MOF characteristics across electronic/atomic/structural hierarchies
2. **Predicts** hydrogen storage performance with 94.8% accuracy
3. **Designs** synthesizable MOF structures through reverse design
4. **Guides** experimental synthesis with actionable recommendations

## Methodology
### Training Pipeline
![Training Flowchart](https://github.com/cgarls/MOFs-LLM/raw/main/Pictures/Flow%20chart.png)
- â€‹**Domain-Specialized LLM**: 210M-token MOF corpus integrating structural descriptions, synthesis protocols, and performance data
- â€‹**Dual Optimization**: Achieves 94.8% prediction accuracy for hydrogen storage while maintaining synthesizability
- â€‹**Experimental Validation**: Successfully synthesized Cu-LLMs-1 with 1.33 wt% room-temperature hydrogen adsorption (top 5 among pure MOFs)
